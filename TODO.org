 TODO: Port the game to Godot 4
  I will work on this when Godot 4 is officially released, as it crashes
  a lot in my computer.

 TODO: Practise mode
 labels: enhancement

  How would this work? there can be a new type of object called "practise_gem" for
  example, and it will store certain variables such as:

  - spdboost
  - gravdir
  - bgcolor
  - gcolor
  - the jukebox song position
  - the vehicle we're in
  - velocity
  - probably something else I can't think of rn

  and there will be an array containing those gems, they will be created
  automatically each number of seconds, or when the player presses "z" and deleted
  when the player presses "x". 

  When dying, if we are in practise mode, get the data from the last gem added to
  the array, and respawn at its position.
