* TODO Finish the level section menu
  I could just make one button (instead of generating them all) and going
  through all the levels in the array, and then emulating the animation?

* TODO Level completion (basically, you can complete a level)
* TODO Death and respawning.
* TODO Calculate the completion percentage of a game.
  I could do this by getting the farthest tile of all tilesets, gettings its
  position and getting the percentage by comparing it with the current
  vehicle.
* TODO Saving and loading.
* TODO Cube selection (I was thinking on making it all like a store?)
* TODO Extra menu.
* TODO User accounts.
* TODO Level Editor.
* TODO Level upload and download.
* TODO Moderator accounts.
  They can set online level stars, difficulty, featured, epic, daily and
  weekly.
* TODO Hall of fame and weekly demon.
* TODO Daily quests.
* TODO Top 100.
* TODO Top creators.
* TODO Wouldn't it be cool to have a country top? Like top 100 Colombia.
* TODO All the originals geometry dash level.
* TODO Realtime multiplayer.
* TODO The ball vehicle.
* TODO The UFO vehicle.
* TODO The wave vehicle.
* TODO The spider vehicle.
* TODO The robot vehicle.
* TODO Port the game to Godot 4
  I will work on this when Godot 4 is officially released, as it crashes
  a lot in my computer.
