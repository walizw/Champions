* Geometry Dash

A Geometry Dash fangame made in the Godot game engine. I want to replicate every
detail from the original game, to make it as accurate as possible.

This is not really that serious, it's mainly so I can learn godot in an actual
project.

The following is a list of things that I want to implement and haven't done it
yet:

- [ ] Finish the level section menu.
  - I could just make one button (instead of generating them all) and going
    through all the levels in the array, and then emulating the animation?
- [ ] Level completion (basically, you can complete a level.)
- [ ] Death and respawning.
- [ ] Calculate the completion percentage of a game.
  - I could do this by getting the farthest tile of all tilesets, gettings its
    position and getting the percentage by comparing it with the current
    vehicle.
- [ ] Saving and loading.
- [ ] Cube selection (I was thinking on making it all like a store?)
- [ ] Extra menu.
- [ ] User accounts.
- [ ] Level Editor.
- [ ] Level upload and download.
- [ ] Moderator accounts.
  - They can set online level stars, difficulty, featured, epic, daily and
    weekly.
- [ ] Hall of fame and weekly demon.
- [ ] Daily quests.
- [ ] Top 100.
- [ ] Top creators.
- [ ] Wouldn't it be cool to have a country top? Like top 100 Colombia.
- [ ] All the originals geometry dash level.
- [ ] Realtime multiplayer.
- [ ] The ball vehicle.
- [ ] The UFO vehicle.
- [ ] The wave vehicle.
- [ ] The spider vehicle.
- [ ] The robot vehicle.
- [ ] Port the game to Godot 4 (when it's ready, as it crashes a lot in my
      computer)
