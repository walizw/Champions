    TODO: Level Editor

    I want this editor not to be as "simple" as the original Geometry Dash
    editor, I want there to be animations, particles, autotiles, lighting and
    trigger management.

    I also want to make it with a Godot-like UI, so yeah, that!

{/*
    TODO: Profile popup

    When the level is clicked - in the lobby - a popup containing a user's
    profile information is shown. This should be a generic popup that's shown
    for every user, but a cogwheel is shown if the popup belongs to the loggedin
    user, there players can set a bio, can set their country, and set
    pleroma-like metadata? that would be great I guess.

{/*
    TODO: Ranking

    There are two types of rankings: stars and trophies. Stars are obtained by
    completing levels, and trophies by winning multiplayer matches. There's also
    a leaderboard for the country of the player (if it's set, if not, a label
    saying "please specify your contry" or something like that is shown instead)

    It would be great if there's an OptionButton so you can switch between stars
    and trophies.

    Also, the first result should be the current logged-in player along with its
    top position, and after that, the rest of the leaderboard is displayed.
