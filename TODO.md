{/*
    TODO: Level Editor
    labels: feature

    I want this editor not to be as "simple" as the original Geometry Dash
    editor, I want there to be animations, particles, autotiles, lighting and
    trigger management.

    I also want to make it with a Godot-like UI, so yeah, that!

{/*
    TODO: Profile popup
    labels: feature

    When the level is clicked - in the lobby - a popup containing a user's
    profile information is shown. This should be a generic popup that's shown
    for every user, but a cogwheel is shown if the popup belongs to the loggedin
    user, there players can set a bio, can set their country, and set
    pleroma-like metadata? that would be great I guess.

{/*
    TODO: Ranking
    labels: feature

    There are three types of rankings: stars, trophies and creators. Stars are
    obtained by completing levels, trophies by winning multiplayer matches and
    the other by creating. There's also a leaderboard for the country of the
    player (if it's set, if not, a label saying "please specify your contry" or
    something like that is shown instead)

    It would be great if there's an OptionButton so you can switch between stars,
    trophies and creators.

    Also, the first result should be the current logged-in player along with its
    top position, and after that, the rest of the leaderboard is displayed.

{/*
    TODO: Death effect
    labels: enhancement

    When the player dies, emit a death effect, this can either be generic
    particles, or an animated death effect that is bought in the store or
    obtained in quests/dailies/chests.
*/}

{/*
    TODO: Store
    labels: feature

    In the store you can buy icons (for any vehicle), colours, trails, death
    effects, and also coins and gems.

    You can use two currencies: coins and gems and the items displayed in the
    store should be refreshed in the server every day, changing the colours,
    the icons and all the goodies that are available to buy.
